  - UI Framework integrations
  - Examples of 'Hello World' Apps
  - Convert `files` into a `proxy` where a file with `path/to/file.ext` would be stored as `"path/to/file.ext"` instead of `"file.ext"` inside an array and given the string `o/file.ext`, the proxy would return the best matching one.

- 2023 July
  - Add an additional icon on hexgrid to show the user that download request has initiated connection. Replace the embedded icons once the download starts or fails.
  - update `docker-web-app.sh` to transfer additional user assets into the container.
